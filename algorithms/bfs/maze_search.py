'''
BFS time complexity : O(|E| + |V|)
BFS space complexity : O(|E| + |V|)

do BFS from (0,0) of the grid and get the minimum number of steps needed to get to the lower right column

only step on the columns whose value is 1

if there is no path, it returns -1

Ex 1)
If grid is
[[1,0,1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,1,0,1,0],
 [1,0,1,0,1,1],
 [1,1,1,0,1,1]], 
the answer is: 14

Ex 2)
If grid is
[[1,0,0],
 [0,1,1],
 [0,1,1]], 
the answer is: -1
